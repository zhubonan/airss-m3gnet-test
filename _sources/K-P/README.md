# Potassium phosphides search

This folder contains 4 subfolders:

1. `K-P-airss-dft`: A set of ~6000 initial cells and final DFT relaxations.
2. `K-P-known-dft`: A set of DFT calculations on known and database-derived K-P phases.
3. `K-P-m3gnet`: A set of M3GNet relaxations of the 6000 initial cells from 1.
4. `bad`: Some bad DFT with spurious results, excluded from the analysis.

The data is taken from:

> Evans, Matthew L, & Morris, Andrew J. (2022). Research data supporting "Tin phosphide anodes for potassium-ion batteries: insights from crystal structure prediction" (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7429088

where CASTEP files in the `searches/searches_KP/castep_files` were processed.
This is a subset of the overall search, where unfortunately not all trajectories were preserved.
